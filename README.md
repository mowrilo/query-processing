# Long Query Processor

This repository provides the codes used on the development of a classifier to remove words from verbose queries. It was based on Apache Lucene.

The main code for the project lies on the 'longquery-search' folder.

The 'dataExamples' folder contains already trained Part-Of-Speech data, as well as training data for the classifiers and tuned Logistic Regression parameters for this dataset.

The folder 'misc' contains some scripts written during the development of the project, with different objectives.
